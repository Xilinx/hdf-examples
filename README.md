# hdf-examples
git repo to contain HDF examples for various boards to support meta-xilinx-tools

NOTE: This repository is deprecated, as the XSA files referenced are getting too
large to store in a git repository.  See the hdf-examples recipe in the
meta-xilinx-tools layer for the current location of these items.
